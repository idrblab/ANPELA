\value{
The \strong{process_res} folder stores the results of various data processing workflows. The form of data processing output files is decided by the parameter \code{save_processed_res}: "one_folder" denotes that successfully processed results will be saved as separate RData files in the "process_res" folder; "one_RData" denotes that all processed results will be saved as one RData file in the "process_res" folder [\emph{default ="one_folder"}].

\description{
FCprocess() enables high-throughput processing for SCP data acquired from FC by at most ~960 available workflows based on parallel computing (each workflow is distinct by combining different methods of compensation, transformation, normalization and signal clean), which facilitates the subsequent application of performance assessment, ranking and plotting.
