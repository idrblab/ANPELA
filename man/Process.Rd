\item{spillpath}{Character, the absolute filepath(s) of compensation beads or cells. The spillover information for a particular experiment is often obtained by running several tubes of beads or cells stained with a single color that can then be used to determine a spillover matrix for use.
\if{html}{\out{<br>}}Only needed when "FlowCore" is included in the argument of "compensationM".The filenames of the FCS files must correspond to the names of stain channels. If the original FCS files contain a pre-calculated spillover matrix as the value of the $SPILLOVER, $spillover or $SPILL keywords, this can be set as NULL.}

\value{
The \strong{process_res} folder stores the results of various data processing workflows. The form of data processing output files is decided by the parameter \code{save_processed_res}: "one_folder" denotes that successfully processed results will be saved as separate RData files in the "process_res" folder; "one_RData" denotes that all processed results will be saved as one RData file in the "process_res" folder [\emph{default ="one_folder"}].
\if{html}{\out{<br>}}In addition, the file \strong{info_saved.RData} is also generated simultaneously, recording the information related to "metadata" and "index_protein".

\description{
Process() enables high-throughput processing for SCP data acquired from FC or MC by the most available workflows respectively, based on parallel computing (each workflow is distinct by combining different methods of compensation, transformation, normalization and signal clean), which facilitates the subsequent application of performance assessment, ranking and plotting.
